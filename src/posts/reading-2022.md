This year I read twenty-two books in total. Before I go into the specific books, I'll note some themes.

Earlier in the year, I spent a fair amount of time reading about western political history, specifically the English Civil War and the period from the accession of James I in 1603 to the "Glorious Revolution" of 1688. This is part of a broader objective of mine to understand the historical trajectory of capitalism. I want to chart its emergence and evolution by studying history at the following key junctures: the English Civil War and the emergence of parliamentary democracy from feudal absolute monarchy; the American Revolution and War of Independence; the development of the British Empire and its machine of colonial extraction, enslavement and dispossession; the French Revolution and Enlightenment; and finally, land enclosure and the Industrial Revolution. This will probably take many years but I now feel I have a better grasp of the development of English democracy and the Liberal principles that shaped it and which continue to be touchstones in contemporary pro-Western capitalist discourse.

Other than history and politics I read a great deal of science fiction as always. I had quite a challenging year in my personal life and I'll often binge on SF novels as it helps me to escape stressful realities.

Let's go through the books...

## Dorinda Outram, The Enlightenment (2013)

This was a short primer designed for undergraduate students. The key aspects I recall are the gaping contradictions between the ideals of the key figures and the extant social and political realities they were prepared to abide. Chiefly the existence of slavery and the subjugation of women whilst supposedly believing in the fundamental equality and dignity of all human beings. Also interesting was the debate over the extent to which the violence of the French Revolution (typically viewed as book-ending the Enlightenment) was a consequence or a corruption of the radical debates that preceded it.

## James Lovelock, Gaia (1979)

Lovelock died shortly after I finished this. An interesting figure not afraid to question scientific orthodoxy. The main thing I took from my reading was an awareness of the technical problem of how to remotely determine whether a planet supports life. If you can't visit an exoplanet because of the distances involved, how might you detect biosignatures? It was whilst working on this problem for NASA that Lovelock (in collaboration with Lynn Margullis) conceived of the Earth as a self-sustaining complex system over and above its specific subsystems (soil, tides, weather, geology, organic evolution etc).

## Ananyo Bhattacharya, The Man from the Future (2021)

This biography of John von Neumann comprehensively validates the author's thesis that he was the single most important scientist of the 20th century in terms of sheer breadth and contemporary relevance. The genius's genius. It offers a compelling and fairly comprehensible account of his contributions to  
 pure mathematics, quantum physics, computer science, economics, artificial intelligence and cellular automata. It was also interesting to learn how his right-wing geopolitical stance (defence of atomic weapons and the MAD doctrine) derived from his early experiences as a bourgeois during the Bolshevik terror of Bela Kun in Hungary

## Nicolo Machiavelli, The Prince (1532)

This was supposed to be the first of several key texts in political philosophy that I intended to read this year. In the event, I only managed this one. Found it mostly boring to be honest. There were endless descriptions of the political machinations of Renaissance Italian city states that seemed to have little bearing on debates in pure politcal philosophy. His supposed wickedness is much overstated but I suppose it is worthwhile to understand his modern day _real politik_ adherents.

## Sean Carroll, The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning and the Universe Itself (2006)

In most cases, whenever scientists weigh-in on philosophical debates in popular scientific literature, the results are consistently (a) incoherent and naive about the metaphysical nuances (b) pedestrian to the point of platitude (c) based on circular reasoning . (Richard Dawkins on religion is the canonical example of this.) Carroll doesn't buck this trend but his accounts of the current theories of abiogenesis, entropy and Bayesian statistics were clear, enjoyable and thought-provoking. The latter half of the book which focuses on morality in a meaningless and godless universe are safely skippable however.

## Anthony Beevor, The Second World War (2012)

Really great as you'd expect from Beevor. He somehow managed to make the whole conflict comprehensible. He has a gift for working interesting anecdotal facts about the personalities involved (such as the hilariously egotistical and prima donna-ish exploits of the generals, of which, see MacArthur) along side the broader swath of troop movements, resource allocation and strategy.

## Mark Lanegan, Sing Backwards and Weep (2020)

This book starts with a line like _by the time I was 14 I was a full-blown alcoholic_.
I'm not usually a fan of tell-all drug memoirs but despite Lanegan's shortcomings and insatiable appetite for self-destruction he comes across as likeable, extremely funny and a fundamentally decent survivor of a poor and abusive childhood (plus a bloody great singer). It felt like such a triumph when he finally and conclusively liberates himself from drugs and in the process learns to finally accept himself. It was great hearing a first-and account of his friendships with musicians I love such as Kurt Cobain and Layne Stayley.

## Blair Worden, The English Civil Wars (2009)

A bit dry in parts but an impressively condensed account of the key battles and political events.

## A. J Patrick, Britain: The Making of a Nation 1603-1789 (1968)

This was an old school textbook from the 1960s that my Mum had picked up at a jumble sale. Even though it was written for children it was still really interesting both in terms of content and historiography.

## Simon Schama, A History of Britain Vol. II: 1603-1776 The English Wars (2001)

Schama has a playful and quite irreverent style that makes his histories really fun page-turners. This really helped to consolidate and fill in contextual details of the account of the Civil War given by the Worden book.

## Yannis Varoufakis, Talking to My Daughter About the Economy: A Brief History of Capitalism (2013)

This was a friendly yet rigorous account of the main components of the capitalist economy (surplus value production, money and credit, central banks and interest rates etc.). The bit that I remember most was the account at the beginning of the standard model of economic history. How the invention of agriculture gave rise to banks, money, credit, organised religious authority and the state's monopoly on violence. Not for the first time, I reflected on how Marx's theory of historical development is basically, well, right.

## Kim Stanley Robinson, The Ministry for the Future (2020)

A typically dry and colourless book as we should expect from Robinson (he will happily write five pages describing a rock) set in the just-near future where humans are grappling the the biospheric collapse we are currently doing so well to prevent (not). You read Robinson for the ideas rather than the plot or characters and here they are mostly one-dimensional mouthpieces for different ideological and methodology responses to the climate emergency. It is structured in a sort of John Dos Passos way of cascading short chapters written from a variety of perspectives that together create an overlapping composite. Robinson's ideas for solutions are thought-provoking and engaging and whilst he focuses mainly on the actions of technocrats at a Bretton-Woods style NGO (the ministry of the title) he also explores the likelihood of terrorism and unilateral geoengineering by the victims of western-generated climate change in the developing world

## Fyodor Doestoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov (1880)

I obviously can't begin to talk meaningfully about such a book in this summarised format. However I enjoyed it a great deal and, as always with Dostoevsky, found it very funny. People forget how funny he can be amidst all the heavy stuff for which he is mostly remembered. Ultimately I think _Crime and Punishment_ is still the better novel _as_ a novel but this is clearly his most philosophical work and perhaps his greatest in terms of psychological characterisation. Supposedly each of the three brothers is a different aspect of Dostoevsky's own character: Ivan the distainful intellectual and materialist, Dmitri the passionate and compulsive hedonist, and Alyosha the compassionate lover of humanity. I found the famous Grand Inquisitor sequence to be extremely chilling and eerily prescient of both the Holocaust and the Stalinist horrors that would occur in the next century.

## Olaf Stapledon, First and Last Men (1930)

So this was epically boring. In theory I should've really enjoyed it: Marxist sci-fi! But in fact it was an exercise in compulsive listing rather than a work of literature. He charts the evolution of humanity from the end of the First World War to several millennia in the future. It's highly repetitive: a civilization grows-up, destroys itself and then a new civilization develops from the splinters of the old. This is not a process of linear advancement and much of the development is regressive. War is abolished only to return, slavery reoccurs frequently etc etc. There is absolutely zero characterisation or points of colour amid the ceaseless summarising of the same sorts of events. I'll be honest, I skimmed the last fifty pages as I just wanted it to end. I'm re-boring myself writing about it. Unfathomable to me why this is considered a classic of the genre by people I otherwise respect.

## Greg Egan, Diaspora (1997)

A few years back I read Egan's _Permutation City_ which I really enjoyed. This also had high ratings on Reddit so I read it next. It wasn't in the same page-turning league as the first book but it expressed some interesting ideas. The main characters are AIs that are "born" in a quasi-biological manner and which travel through the universe as god-like agglomerations of pure information. They are a bit like the Minds in Bank's Culture series but with less humour. The plot was a bit undercooked.

## Stanislaw Lem, Solaris (1971)

When I first read this about ten years ago I found it to be an affecting meditation on love, memory and loss in the guise of a science-fiction novel (closer to the Tarkovsky film). This time round I was more focused on the science-fictional elements and its shortcomings as a novel such as the verbose summaries of the academic literature on the Solaris anomaly. I still enjoyed it
and the deflationary premise of there being natural phenomena that we are simply not equipped to understand continued to resonate.

## Gene Wolfe, The Fifth Head of Cerberus (1972)

This was another re-read however I got much more out of it this time around. From the first sentence you are aware that you are reading the work of an allusive and illusive master stylist, whose literary technique stands head and shoulders above most other SF writers. (Wolfe is often called the Proust of science-fiction.) It comprises a triptych of novellas that employ the science-fictional trope of cloning with elements of detective stories to offer a profound rumination on colonialism, slavery and cultural displacement. As you read you are actively trying to piece together the different fragmented perspectives into an integrated and consistent whole in order to discern the ultimate "message". As such it invites re-readings and much online interpretation. Brilliant.

## Iain M. Banks, The Player of Games (1988)

I am reading all of the Culture novels in publication sequence. This is the second and perhaps the most highly regarded of all. Whereas _Consider Phlebas_ was rip-roaring tableau in miniature of the main facets of Banks' science-fiction (adventure and peril, technologically robust discussions of artificial intelligence, humour, and political irony) this focuses squarely on simply telling an engaging and well-paced story and is the most technically adept novel of the series I have read so far. A master player of strategy games is seconded by the intelligence-wing of the Culture to play in a tournament organised by a barbarous empire that the Culture has yet to assimilate. Their political system is based on the tournament: whoever wins inherits the throne and the game itself is a simulacrum of diplomacy, war and politics. The protagonist is only supposed to take part in order to gather intelligence however his ego gets the better of him and he ends up winning.

## Iain M. Banks, Use of Weapons (1990)

This was far more experimental in form. The story is told in alternating pairs of chapters where one is set at the end of the novel and the other is set at the beginning. Eventually at the end the two stories converge into a single present. This entry in the Culture series focuses, as the title suggests, on the war and violence that Special Circumstances (the black-ops wing of the Culture) engages in with the ultimate aim of civilising alien cultures that still engage in war and slavery in order to bring them into the enlightened federation of the Culture.

## M. John Harrison, Light (2002)

I had heard of Harrison as an interesting stylist who has captured the esteem of the mainstream literati. This fickle adoption of certain science-fiction writers by the _Guardian_-reading, Islington-dwelling cognoscenti (oh hai, Suella) always irritates me so I was put off from reading him for many years. Ultimately I'm glad I read it. It was as good as people say. It's a profoundly weird and disorientating story told from three perspectives that only slightly overlap. Harrison doesn't provide any stabilisers for the reader and for long periods you are pretty much clueless about what is going on. However, oddly this doesn't stop from being compulsively readable and hilarious especially once you get deeper into it. It's all based around some anomaly arising from quantum physics and the wave function but I can't claim to have understood the details. Still very enjoyable and refreshing to read a work where the writer is pushing the genre to its limits and using it to exercise maximal levels of imaginative creativity.

## William Gibson, Burning Chrome (1982)

These are short stories set in imaginative realm of cyberpunk that Gibson first constructed in _Neuromancer_. Mostly this was interesting as a study of style; the tropes of cyberpunk have long since been assimilated into popular culture and are therefore no longer particularly compelling in themselves.

## Alastair Reynolds, House of Suns (2008)

It took a while for me to become invested in this story but I eventually became really engrossed. It tells the story of "shatterlings": practically eternal beings that comprise thousands of clones of a single human original that were sent out to different parts of the galaxy to explore and gather information and then synthesize their experiences into a composite account. The plot is pretty engaging but above all this book works because of the sense of wonder it evokes in the reader at both its scale and the novelty of its scientific concepts.
