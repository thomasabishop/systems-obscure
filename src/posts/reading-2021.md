This year I read fifteen books: seven novels and eight works of non-fiction. I also completed two audiobooks. In this post I list the books and provide a brief review and summary of what I took from each.

### Noam Chomsky, What Kind of Creatures Are We? (2015)

An engrossing synoptic account of the main currents in Chomsky's thinking across his long career. He starts with his contributions to linguistics, moving into the theory of knowledge and how both inform his anarchist political outlook. He ends with reflections on the limits of human understanding and the role and nature of scientific explanation. This short book demonstrates Chomsky's profound appreciation of western intellectual history from the period of the Enlightenment onwards. He presents a thoroughly naturalised conception of human beings as biological entities endowed with faculties that both faciliate and circumscribe the systematic understanding of their environment.

### Max Tegmark, Life 3.0 (2017)

This provided an intelligible summary of some aspects of the engineering behind recent advances in AI but I found the self-satisfied Silicon Valley tone quite disagreeable. I also find it hard to take 'existential threat' analyses of AI seriously when there are so many more immediate and tangible threats to civilization.

### P.H. Matthews, Linguistics: A Very Short Introduction (2003)

A very useful introduction to the main areas of study within the science of linguistics. This book served as a roadmap for topics I would like to study in greater depth. For example I found the descriptions of phonology and the physical basis of speech production profoundly boring. Similarly ethnological discussions of the variance between language families. However I was fascinated by topics in theoretical linguistics and the systematic and computational approach to syntax inaugerated by Chomsky's programme and cognitive science more broadly.

### Steven Pinker, The Language Instinct (1994)

An approachable yet thorough account of Chomskian linguistics and the fundamental precepts of cognitive science. No doubt much of this is now outdated but even so I found the discussion of research in psycholinguistics very interesting. The empirical work that Pinker cites caused me to reconsider the validity of certain ideas in the philosophy of mind and language.

### Avrum Stroll, Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy (2000)

A useful and engaging reminder of the main topics in the last 150 years of the philosophy of language in the Anglophone tradition. Notwithstanding the obvious centrality of language and philosophical logic to analytic philosophy, there was scant or no coverage of other areas such as moral and political philosophy, epistemology or the philosophy of mind. It is therefore questionable whether this is a complete history of the tradition. The book was at its weakest when the author offered his own arguments on contemporary debates such as direct reference theories of names. I wish he maintained an expository approach throughout since most of his arguments seemed to me to be based on misreadings and crude simplifications or frustratingly opaque gestures to the ordinary person's use of language.

### Andy Hunt & Dave Thomas, The Pragmatic Programmer (1999)

Although most of the examples were written in languages I do not know or use (mostly Java and C++), the discussions of abstraction, decoupling and the core concepts of object-oriented programming were invaluable.

### Andrew Chaikin, A Man on the Moon: Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts (1994)

A fascinating account of the Apollo programme and its precursors. The author details each Apollo mission from launch to splashdown delving deep into both the scientific objectives and the personal lives and psychology of the astronauts.

### Frank Herbert, Dune (1965)

I love SF so it's kind of bizarre that this was my first reading of what is widely considered to be the best science fiction novel ever written. Much is made of Herbert's introduction of ecology to science fiction and the anti-imperialist tone of the novel. I didn't find these aspects of the novel that compelling however this may be simply because after Dune, such themes became mainstays of the genre. That said, the idea of an ecologically balanced 'primitive' culture under threat from an avaricious empire that exports its resources and destroys its ancient way of life has obvious contemporary overtones. One thinks of the exclusion of the representatives of indigenous peoples at this year's depressing COP summit at Glasgow. At bottom, this is a brilliantly realised example of world-building by an obvious master. As a work of thrilling and immersive speculative fiction it is second to none.

### Roger Williams, The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect (2002)

A gripping 'AI takes over the world' tale. The scope of the story given the novella length is impressive. It reminded me in part of philosophical novels like _Candide_ and _Gulliver's Travels_. Interestingly it was written by a software engineer and self-published online in 1994. It is still available [here](http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/mopiidx.html) in all it's plain HTML glory.

### Kim Stanley Robinson, Aurora (2015)

During the lock-downs last year I worked my way through Robinson's magnum opus: the three volume _Mars Trilogy_ first published in the 1990s. Aside from being a skilled work of hard science fiction it had a deep impact on my thinking and in particular the relationship between science and engineering and revolutionary political theory. Robinson presents his scientists as complex fully rounded intellectuals whose scientific work proceeds with an abiding moral and political understanding of the world(s). Reddit suggests _Aurora_ is supposed to be his second-best work. I have to disagree with the consensus. Whilst the novel has some beau- Grateful Dead _American Beauty_
ues managed by the ship's AI who is also the narrator of the story. They return to Earth and everyone hates them for failing in their objective. It's cool that the story is told by the AI but it is left unexplained how the story continues once the AI is destroyed about three-quarters of the way in to the novel.

### Margaret Atwood, The Handmaids Tale (1984)

Another classic I only read this year. I made a mistake in reading the novel immediately after finishing the outstanding TV adaptation. I think I would have appreciated the novel more without the afterimage of the series in my mind's eye. The novel is highly allusive and literary but I did find myself sort of wondering what all the fuss was about. The first third of the book is plain boring. The latter half becomes more stimulating as the plot quickens but overall it just seemed grey to me. I think this is a case of science fictional themes achieving 'crossover' and respectability simply because they have been adopted by a literary _writer_. Philip Roth's _The Plot Against America_ which basically copies the core premise of Philip K. Dick's _The Man in the High Castle_ is another example of this. Kazuo Ishiguro's _Never Let Me Go_ is yet another.

### Cixin Liu, The Three Body Problem (2008)

This is a work of Chinese science fiction that has achieved success in the west. The plot is complicated but it's basically a rumination on the [Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox). The novel flips between two timelines: the present day and the Cultural Revolution. The depiction of the insane violence and mass hysteria of the latter period was extemely chilling and troubling, all of it factual.

### Ursula LeGuin, The Dispossessed (1974)

Last year I read _The Left Hand of Darkness_ and it knocked my socks off. In contrast, I was rather disappointed with _The Dispossessed_ mainly because the plot didn't really deliver on its promise. Set within the same Hainish universe of the earlier book it tells a story of the planet Urras and its moon Annares. Urras is basically an advanced capitalist civilisation, its wealth built on the exploitation and violent subjugation of its productive class. Annares, in contrast, is a poor communist society built on collectivist anarchist principles. There is no war, racism, private property, class distinctions, or sexual inequality etc. A physicist from Annares travels to the planet as his revolutionary scientific ideas are poorly received by his native society and he wishes to confer with the more advanced scientific community on Urras. What follows is kind of _Coming to America_ scenario where the anarchist struggles to understand the alien mode of production and the unnecessary suffering it engenders. At the same time he is not so closed-minded that he is unable to appreciate the material benefits and scientific advancements achieved by Urras. I think of LeGuin as writer of what I call _social-science_ fiction. There are spaceships and familiar SF tropes but above all she is interested in anthropology and sociology. These are the sciences she fictionalises and her intent is fundamentally political. It is to her credit that even thoush she was personally sympathetic to anarchism she does not idealise the society she depicts. We see that selfishness and petty jealousy persist and that the individual is in many ways subordinate to the collectivist ideal. Moreover we learn that maintaining a radically non-coercive lateralised society is extremely hard work, demanding endless meetings and huge investments of time whilst providing very little in the way of diversion, pleasure and comfort. Overall, the ideas were highly engaging however the plot meandered and didn't really amount to much. In _Left Hand_ the ideas were subordinate to the literary form but here they overburden the novel and get in the way of the telling of a compelling and satisfying story with a clear arc and resolution.

### Philip K. Dick, Martian Time Slip (1964)

I used to read a lot of PKD when I was younger and I mainly picked this up as a short buffer novel in between reading two longer books. All the standard Dickian themes are in evidence: mental illness, the paradoxes of personal identity, Cold War anxieties and the heroic everyman chosing to act bravely and with integrity as reality shatters all around him.

### Iain M. Banks, Consider Phlebas (1987)

This was a fun and well-written space opera. The first Culture novel and the first work I have read by Banks. I wonder what his broader message is beyond an abiding scepticism of utopian science fiction and would be interested to read academic interpretations of the Culture.

### Arthur C. Clarke, Rendevouz with Rama (1987)

The concept is reminiscent of _2001_ and _Solaris_: a strange interstellar object, possibly a probe from an advanced civilisation, appears in the solar system. A crew is sent to investigate and find out what it is and what its purpose might be. However they fail utterly, their conceptual framework balking at the prospect of something so alien and unintelligible. There is no sense of a resolution or final reveal. We are left just as clueless as the investigators by the end of the novel and the inscrutable object simply continues on its onward journey past the sun and out of the system. When I finished the book I felt quite disappointed and short-changed by this unsatisfying conclusion but on reflection I think it is a rather interesting move of Clarke's to leave us in ignorance. There is a strong sense of realism to such an ending: we understand so little about the universe and the gap between us and a truly advanced, technologically mature alien civilisation would be unbridgeable. We would be like ants crawling along the toe of a colossus.
