With the way the internet Internet (and the world) is going, the benefit of
self-hosting is becoming increasingly obvious. Unfortunately, this remains the
preserve of a technical minority, with most people forced either to accept the
abolition of their right to privacy or to put their trust in supposedly
"ethical" vendors of the online services and resources they require. Typically
these services sooner or later sell-out and become simply another vector of
online exploitation, eroding consumer trust and hastening the downward spiral of
Internet [getting worse]

There's a lot of smugness and self-regard amongst the online technocracy
vis-a-vis the virtues of self-hosting. I hope not to add to that here because
it's cringe and tedious in itself but also erects another barrier to the wider
adoption of the Internet models we claim to want to promote. However, I will say
that the sense of agency one gains in the process of setting up a server and
taking privacy-promoting actions more generally, is gratifying and perhaps
approximates the excitement people felt in the early era of the WWW before
corporate homogenisation and the advent of surveillance capitalism. It's just
too bad everyone cannot experience this. But who knows! Perhaps things will
eventually become so bad that it will become necessary and customary to keep a
server in your basement.

That's enough pontificating, let me get into the details.

Eventually, I hope to maintain my own physical server but given my current
accommodation, this isn't an option presently. Consequently, I've opted to
maintain a remote virtual private server. The first task was to decide on a
provider. The following factors influenced my decision:

- jurisdiction
  - The server should be physically based in country with solid privacy laws
    with a culture of resistance to state surveillance
- location
  - It shouldn't be so far away as to add unnecessary latency since I have no
    intention of using one of the three big corporate CDNs
- price
  - My current monthly AWS fees are very low (-1 GBP) but doing anything
    interesting becomes rapidly expensive. Also, I want to divest from Jeff. I
    am prepared to spend up to 10 GBP a month, at least initially.
