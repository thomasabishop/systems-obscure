As part of our holiday this year my girlfriend and I went to visit Bletchley
Park and The National Museum of Computing.

Sparing no expense and with our customary taste for luxury, we stayed in one of
the three Premier Inn's in Milton Keynes. Milton Keynes is odd: a car park in
search of a town. However, we had the good fortune to overlook one of its many
supermalls. This is notable only because it _looks exactly like a sandworm in
Dune_. No, really:

Bletchley was excellent. We spent four to five hours working our way through
each of the huts, most of which have been converted into individual exhibition
spaces.

Personal highlights included

And the usual GCHQ PR psyop chumminess. (I find their "Christmas puzzle book"
such an ick. Why can't they just violate our privacy quietly instead of
pretending to be everyone's mate?)
