Last night I was reading the Borges story 'Three Versions of Judas' (from _Fictions_ (1944)). It proceeds in a typical Borges fashion, being an ultra-condensed exegesis of a series of fictitious texts, complete with footnotes, fabricated publication dates, page numbers and other literary minutae.

The story describes the work of an obscure theologian who developed a revisionist account of the role of Judas in the Passion, in keeping with the Gnostic _Gospel of Judas_. Far from being the villain and the perennial embodiment of self-interested betrayal, an argument is developed that reconceives him as an agent of the Holy Spirit. Judas is presented as the pivotal catalyst in the fulfilment of Christ's prophesy and thus the redemption of humanity.

The argument is compelling: why would it be necessary to _betray_ Jesus anyway? His activities were well known to both the Jewish authorities and the Romans. If the same Gospels that cast Judas as the betrayer are to be believed, he was literally walking around overturning political and social conventions, performing miracles and allowing himself to be called the Messiah at every opportunity. They could've come for him at any point and moreover, he wasn't in hiding.

According to the scholar, Judas was the truest disciple because he had a presentiment of the Crucifixion, and was predetermined to condemn himself to death, achieving eternal infamy in emulation of Christ. It's kind of like that bit at the end of _The Dark Knight_ where Batman allows himself to be framed as the villain for the greater good. Hence the kiss and discarding the silver at the temple. Hence also, Jesus's remark to Judas at the Last Supper: "what you are going to do, do quickly".

Anyway, this elaborate preamble has been merely to draw attention to a passage in John (the most interesting and mystical of the Gospels) that Borges quotes. I think it is very profound and poetic - a lossless compression of the entirety of Christianity to a single line:

> He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.

&mdash; John 1: 10, King James Version

(Just to be clear, although I was raised Catholic, I am not a Christian or a theist but then the Lord works in mysterious ways!)
