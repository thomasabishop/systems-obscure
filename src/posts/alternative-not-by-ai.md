I like the sentiment of [this](https://notbyai.fyi/), but I do think the guy is
having a laugh charging a subscription for the commercial use of an SVG and a
vague "confirmation" that your work has not been produced by AI (unprovable _a
priori_ in my opinion since LLMs will be used to identify whether LLMs have been
used and we end up in a strange loop).

I think this would be better administrated by the Creative Commons, but they are
[fence-sitting](https://creativecommons.org/2023/08/18/understanding-cc-licenses-and-generative-ai/)
presently. Anyway I made my own more ironical versions (available
[here](https://github.com/thomasabishop/not-by-ai-alternative)).
